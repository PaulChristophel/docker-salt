== docker-salt

A lightweight container to provide a salt-master service.

=== Goals

The goal of this project is to create a small container that provides a salt-master service to manage minions. This image currently supports:

* salt-ssh
* ldap authentication
* gpg encrypted pillar data
* postgresql returners.

It can easily be configured to add or remove support for other modules, but these were the essential requirements for the project when the container was configured. To add or remove modules, simply update the requirements.txt.
